      I worked on two different projects. The first one was to add **accessibilty** on the existing
      Nespresso website. The aim was to follow patterns and rules in order to make it usable for
      everyone including blind people for example.

      Before, Nespresso was using a dedicated mobile website but they wanted a unique across devices
      experience. So we decided to rewrite it using modern technologies such as React, Redux,
      Webpack and others.

      **Tasks:**
      - Organise, plan and split features implementation
      - Bootstrap the responsive website front-end
      - Research and develoment in order to find solutions to specifications
      - Implements features regarding specifications and solutions found
#      - Add tests and resove bugs

#      **Realisations:**
#      - Accessibility on the Nespresso website
#      - Responsive behavior on the Nesspresso website

      My role was to create a simple, innovative and creative
      user interfaces with **realtime** data updates.
      Using an **restful** API calls, and **websocket** events,
      I built single page **web apps** and **mobile apps** to display the states
      of the vehicles and allow users to interact with them.

      During the development of the web-app, we have changed
      technologies. Actually, firstly we have chosen MeteorJS in order to
      create quickly a prototype. But then me moved on a full-**ReactJS** + **NodeJS**
      web-application.

      **Tasks:**
      - Take part to discussions on the improvements and features to add
      - Discuss with the designer on the best way to add the chosen features
      - Implement the mockups of the designer
      - Add interactivity to the user interface
#      - Resolve bugs and improve efficency

#      **Realisations:**
#      - 3 web-apps (Meteor, NodeJS, ReactJS, Coffescript, Less, Sass, Webpack...)
#      - a mobile App (Meteor, Cordova, React, React Native, Coffescript, Sass...)

      # - npm

#      The typical user of the web-app is a transport technician.
#      So I have to take habits and standards of transport into account
#      in order to improve its experience using the application.
#      The mobile app is for customers, so here, the target is different and
#      the app must be simple and easy to use.
